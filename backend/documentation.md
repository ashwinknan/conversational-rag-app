# Tick

Applying Tick logic template to an asset allows you to attach a custom timer, whose start and stop can be controlled. This logic template can be used as a starting event for other logic templates

To add the Tick logic template to an asset, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select Tick under the header "Conditionals".
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.

You can edit the following parameters of this template directly through the scene editor interface:\


<table><thead><tr><th width="216">Parameters</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tick When</td><td><p>You can choose the start event for the object's timer from this dropdown:</p><ul><li>Game Start</li><li>Broadcast Received: When the object receives a broadcast message.</li></ul><p><br></p></td></tr><tr><td>Stop When</td><td>You can choose which broadcast will stop the execution when listened to.</td></tr><tr><td>Resume When</td><td>You can choose which broadcast will resume the execution when listened to.</td></tr><tr><td>Special Broadcasts</td><td><p>You can specify time intervals for the template to run and generate a broadcast. The available fields are:</p><ul><li><strong>When</strong>: Select "At" or "Every".</li><li><strong>In</strong>: Specify the time interval for the broadcast.</li><li><strong>Broadcast</strong>: Define the broadcast to be generated.</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Accessing the Tick Logic Template using T\#

If you want to further customize this logic template, you can do so by accessing its T# Wrapper -  [TickTemplate](../../coding-using-t/t-logic-template-wrappers.md#ticktemplate)

# AND Gate

The **AND** operator is used when you want an event to occur only after a specific number of other events have taken place. When broadcasts are received from all the events specified in the **AND** operator behavior, another broadcast is triggered.

For example, the player only wins the game if they complete both of the game's checkpoints. When the player reaches each checkpoint, a broadcast is sent to the behaviour. Once the behavior receives both broadcasts, the game will end.

To add the AND Gate logic template to an asset, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select AND Gate under the header "Conditionals".
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.

You can edit the following parameters of this template directly through the scene editor interface:

<table><thead><tr><th width="282">Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wait For (Listen for)</td><td>Choose the broadcasts which are prerequisite for the operator to do further tasks. You can choose broadcasts from the selection menu. </td></tr><tr><td>Broadcast Data</td><td>Choose to enter a broadcast that can be used as a trigger for any other behavior. <br>The broadcast is sent when the behaviour has received all broadcasts.</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Accessing the AND Gate Logic Template using T\#

You can directly use conditionals in T# and do not need a wrapper to access thie logic template


# OR Gate

The Or Operator is used when you want an event to occur when either one of the defined events has taken place. When broadcasts are received from any event indicated in the Or Operator behavior, the behaviour will perform a particular action.

Example: When the player completes either of the two checkpoints and the operator receives a broadcast message from either of them, the next event scheduled by the behavour is triggered.

To add the OR Gate logic template to an asset, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select OR Gate under the header "Conditionals".
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.

You can edit the following parameters of this template directly through the scene editor interface:

<table><thead><tr><th width="282">Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wait For (Listen for)</td><td>Choose the broadcasts which are prerequisite for the operator to do further tasks. You can choose broadcasts from the selection menu. </td></tr><tr><td>Broadcast Data</td><td>Choose to enter a broadcast that can be used as a trigger for any other behavior. <br>The broadcast is sent when the behaviour has received all broadcasts.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Accessing the OR Gate Template using T\#

You can directly use conditionals in T# and do not need a wrapper to access thie logic template


# Switch

The Switch logic template enables you to regulate the behaviors of an asset, whether it's the one you're interacting with or a different one. You can transmit broadcasts to activate or deactivate behaviors depending on the triggers associated with each action.&#x20;

For instance, suppose a cube possesses a switch logic template. In that case, when the player collides with the cube, an 'on-broadcast' signal is dispatched to the laser, prompting its rotation. Conversely, clicking on the cube sends an 'off-broadcast' signal to the laser, ceasing its rotation.

To add the Switch logic template to an asset, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select Switch under the header "Conditionals".
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.

You can edit the following parameters of this template directly through the scene editor interface:

<table><thead><tr><th width="313">Parameters</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Switch On</td><td><p>You can choose the trigger that will turn "on" the switch:</p><p>- When a different object touches the object<br>- After a broadcast message has been received by the object</p><p>-When the player exits.<br>- When the player collides with the object.<br>- When the object is clicked </p></td></tr><tr><td>Sound Effect When On</td><td>Choose a sound effect to play when the switch is turned "on"</td></tr><tr><td>Visual Effect When On</td><td>Choose a visual effect to play when the switch is turned "on"</td></tr><tr><td>Broadcast After On</td><td>Choose to enter a broadcast that can be used as a trigger for any other behavior. <br>The broadcast is sent when switch is turned "on"</td></tr><tr><td>Switch Off</td><td><p>You can choose the trigger that will turn "off" the switch:</p><p>- When a different object touches the object<br>- After a broadcast message has been received by the object</p><p>-When the player exits.<br>- When the player collides with the object<br>- When the object is clicked</p></td></tr><tr><td>Sound Effect When Off</td><td>Choose a sound effect to play when the switch is turned "off"</td></tr><tr><td>Visual Effect When Off</td><td>Choose a visual effect to play when the switch is turned "off"</td></tr><tr><td>Broadcast After Off</td><td>Choose to enter a broadcast that can be used as a trigger for any other behavior. <br>The broadcast is sent when switch is turned "off"</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Accessing the Switch Logic Template using T\#

If you want to further customize this logic template, you can do so by accessing its T# Wrapper -  [SwitchTemplate](../../coding-using-t/t-logic-template-wrappers.md#switchtemplate)


# Triggers

<table><thead><tr><th width="262">Logic Template</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><a href="collide.md">Collide</a></td><td>Uses contact of collider of the player as a trigger and allows you to generate a broadcast</td></tr><tr><td><a href="click.md">Click</a></td><td>Uses mouse click as a trigger and allows you to generate broadcast</td></tr><tr><td><a href="delay.md">Delay</a></td><td>Introduces a delay of a specified time</td></tr></tbody></table>

# Delay

The Delay logic template allows you to add a few seconds of delay in between the broadcasts which eventually creates a gap of a few seconds between two different events. Usually, events happen instantly as soon as they receive the broadcast but with the help of a delay behavior, you can add a delay between two events.

To add the Delay logic template to an asset, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select Delay under the header "Triggers".
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.

You can edit the following parameters of this template directly through the scene editor interface:

<table><thead><tr><th width="279">Parameters</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Listen To</td><td>Choose a broadcast from the drop drop menu. Once the object receives this broadcast, there will be a delay created for the next event.</td></tr><tr><td>Delay Time</td><td>Define the seconds by how long there will be a delay</td></tr><tr><td>Broadcast</td><td>Choose to enter a broadcast that can be used as a trigger for any other behavior. <br>The broadcast is sent after the defined delay time has completed.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Accessing the Delay Logic Template using T\#

If you want to further customize this logic template, you can do so by accessing its T# Wrapper -  [DelayBroadcastTemplate](../../coding-using-t/t-logic-template-wrappers.md#delaybroadcasttemplate)


# Collide

Any object with the Collide logic template attached sends a broadcast either when you collide with it or when a different object touches it.

To add the Collide logic template to an asset, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select Collide under the header "Triggers".
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.

You can edit the following parameters of this template directly through the scene editor:

<table><thead><tr><th width="259">Parameters</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Start On</td><td>Choose how to collide. You have OnPlayerCollide or OtherObjectTouches</td></tr><tr><td>Play SFX</td><td>Choose a sound effect to play when you collide with the object.</td></tr><tr><td>Play VFX</td><td>Choose a visual effect to play when you collide with the object.</td></tr><tr><td>BroadcastData</td><td>Choose to enter a broadcast that can be used as a trigger for any other behavior. <br>The broadcast is sent when you collide with the object.</td></tr></tbody></table>

| Jump Force     | Define the multiplier by which the existing jump height will be multiplied for that instance                                                                                  |
| Broadcast Data | <p>Choose to enter a broadcast that can be used as a trigger for any other behavior. <br><code>The broadcast is sent when the player jumps at an increased height.</code></p> |

{% hint style="info" %}
Your Jump Height should ideally be greater than 2 for the Jump Pad to work. Small jump height values will not lead to an increased jump height. You can find Jump Height in the Player Controller Drawer. Eg: A jump Height of 0.1 with a Jump Force of 10 will change the total jump height to 0.01 which is lower than the initial height.

Interpolate Points&#x20;
{% endembed %}



Multi-Point Move is a logic template that allows you to instruct an Asset to follow a path made up of several points once its Start Event occurs. This path can be straight lines or curves between the points, giving you many choices for how the Asset moves.

The Asset can automatically turn to make sure a specific side always points towards the path, just like how our face turns to the direction we are moving.

To add the Multi-Point Move logic template, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select Multi-Point Move under the header "Mechanics".
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.

You can customize the below-mentioned parameters according to your requirements:

<table><thead><tr><th width="204">Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Move On</td><td>This is a dropdown from where you need select any one of the following Start Events for Interpolate Points to begin executing: <br> <br>1. When the behavior  when the game starts: Select "Game Start"<br>2. When any other Asset touches the currently selected Asset: Select "Other Object Touch"<br>3. When a particular broadcast is generated in the game: Select "Broadcast Listened" and specify the name of the signal to listen to<br>4. When the player touches the currently selected Asset: Select "Player Touchers"<br>5. When the Asset is clicked: Select "On Click" </td></tr><tr><td>Points</td><td>This helps you specify the coordinates of the multiple points through which the Asset will move in a path. Click the + button to add points and - button to remove an existing point</td></tr><tr><td>Speed</td><td>This is an input field where you can enter a number that represents the speed of Asset movement</td></tr><tr><td>Turn To Points</td><td>This toggle button ensures that only one side of the Asset always faces forward. When activated, it adjusts the Asset's orientation to maintain this specific direction during movement.</td></tr><tr><td>Delay at Point</td><td>This field lets you set a delay in seconds. During this delay, the Asset will not move. After the time passes, it will start moving again.</td></tr><tr><td>Loop</td><td>This toggle button, when activated, enables the movement to repeat continuously</td></tr><tr><td>Is Curve</td><td>This toggle button alters the Asset's trajectory between points to follow a curved path instead of a linear one.</td></tr><tr><td>Interpolate Types</td><td><p></p><p>This dropdown lets you pick how the object moves:</p><ul><li>For forward movement only, select <strong>One Direction</strong></li><li>For back-and-forth movement, select <strong>Ping Pong</strong></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td>Broadcast Type &#x26; Broadcast Signal</td><td><p>The Broadcast Signal option allows you to create a game signal that other can act as the Start Event for other behavior blocks to execute. You can choose "Game Win", "Game Lose", or create your own custom signal. For a custom signal, you must select "Custom" from the dropdown and enter a name in the input field.<br><br>The Broadcast Type dropdown lets you specify when the broadcast signal will be sent. There are three options to choose from:</p><ul><li>If you want no broadcast to be sent, Select Never</li><li>If you want to send a broadcast after finishing one whole movement from start to end, select End </li><li>If you want to send the broadcast signal every time the object pauses , select At Every Pause</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Accessing the Modify Carryable Template using T\#

Currently, there's no T# Wrapper available to customize this logic template beyond the scene editor's capabilities. However, you can write your own code in T# to implement this logic from scratch.


# Treadmill

The Treadmill Logic Template simulates treadmill movement for objects or the Player upon touch.

To add the Treadmill logic template, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select Treadmill under the header "Mechanics".
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.

You can edit the following parameters of this template directly through the scene editor interface:

| Parameter                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

# Basic Instantiate

The Basic Instantiate behavior facilitates the dynamic spawning of identical objects in various locations during gameplay. It allows for controlled timing and quantity of object spawns.

You can determine where objects appear in the game scene by specifying a range of X, Y, and Z coordinates or by randomizing their location within a designated area. With the first method, you have precise control over the specific combinations of coordinates where objects will spawn. Alternatively, using the random allocation option, you can define an area using the record feature, allowing objects to appear randomly within that area during gameplay.

To add the Basic Instantiate logic template to an asset, follow these steps:

1. Go to the Logic Tab.
2. Select Basic Instantiate under the header "Action".
3. Drag and drop it onto the desired asset.&#x20;

   2. `GetComponents<T>`
   3. `AddComponent<T> // even the non generic one isn't allowed currently`
   4. `FindObjectOfType<T>`
   5. `FindObjectsOfType<T>`
   6. `GetComponentInParent<T>`
   7. `GetComponentsInParent<T>`
   8. `GetComponentInChildren<T>`
   9. `GetComponentsInChildren<T>`
2. Enumerable on Transform
   1. This is a problem currently in interpreter. We can ask for a fix or try fixing ourselves.
   2. Can be overcome by using a for loop, in combination with `transform.childCount` and `transform.GetChild(i)`
3. foreach loops
   1. Foreach loops are currently disabled.
4. Lambdas, delegates, Actions, Events, Funcs, UnityEvents
   1. The generic versions are the problem mostly. I don't think these are solvable unless (read : next section Pt1)
   2. The non generic ones need to be tested.
5. Unboxing.
   1. This is a problem currently in interpreter. We can ask for a fix or try fixing ourselves. An actual fix might not be possible however due to language limitations. Unsure.
   2. Ex : `object boxedVal = (int)3; //no problem int failingUnboxedVal = (int)boxedVal; //doesn't work int workingUnboxedVal = Convert.ToInt32(boxedVal); //works`
6. Calling GetComponent instantly after Instantiate call
   1. Because of the current structure. Can be fixed with a change in structure.
   2. The parallel mono is actually created whenever the Start of any script on an object is called. If you use `GetComponent()` instantly after Instantiate, the mono does not exist yet.
7. SerializedFields
   1. They aren’t currently supported.
   2. The alternative is to use, ObjectVariables which is a component that gets auto added on every object which has a `TerraMachine`. You can add any `GameObject` references to this, and access them from a script using `GetObjectVariable(key)` and `SetObjectVariable(key)`
8. Turning Event Functions Into Coroutines
   1. In normal Unity, you can use `IEnumerator Start()` and make your Start function act as a coroutine. This is not possible with interpreter currently.
9. Obvious things that will not behave as expected however shouldn’t be required by games
   1. `async` code
   2. `Tasks`
   3. Anything related to `GetType()` or `typeof()`

# T# Basics

## About T\#

Earlier, creators ability to make a variety of games was limited by the number of logic templates that were available in its logic template library.&#x20;

To remove this limitation , we introduce a new scripting language -  - which has a syntax almost similar to C#. This was developed to provide developers who are used to writing code the flexibility to do almost anything on Terra's platforms.&#x20;

A knowledge of Unity C# makes it super easy for you learn T#, but you need to take care of certain things that are different in T#. Read the [T# Don'ts](t-donts.md) to be aware of these.

T# removes this constraint. Now even if you don't have a logic template in Terra Studio, you can go ahead and write your own script to make that happen.

## Creating your own Script

You can create your own T# scripts to customize game behavior. Here's how:

1. Click the Scripts Tab in the left panel.
2. To add a new script:
   1. Click the `+` icon.
   2. Enter a name and press Enter.&#x20;
3. Double-click the file to open it. Your script will compile and be ready.
4. The Visual Studio Code IDE will open all the scripts in the project.&#x20;
5. Locate your script in the Scripts Directory.&#x20;
6. You can now edit the default code to achieve your  desired behavior

## Adding your Script to an Asset

Scripts define how assets behave during gameplay. To enable this, attach a script to an asset. Here's how you can do it:

1. Select the asset to add the script
2. Go to the Logic Tab on the left
3. Drag and drop the Studio Machine Behavior onto the asset.
4. Enable Advanced Mode. The Inspector Panel appears on the right.
5. Go to the Studio Machine Tab in the Inspector Panel and open the dropdown to see all scripts in the project.&#x20;
6. Choose the script you want to add.

## Basic Structure of a default T# Script

When you open a script in Visual Studio Code, a default script like this appears:

<pre class="language-csharp"><code class="lang-csharp">
using System;
using System.Collections;
using Terra.Studio;
using Terra.Studio.Exposed;
using Terra.Studio.Exposed.Layers;
using UnityEngine;

public class MyFirstScript : StudioBehaviour
{
    private void Start()
    {
       
    }

    private void Update()
    {
       
    }

    public override void OnBroadcasted(string x)
    {
        
    }
}

<strong>
</strong></code></pre>

Note an important difference:&#x20;

Terra Studio uses `StudioBehavior` and not `MonoBehavior`&#x20;

```csharp
public class MyFirstScript : StudioBehaviour
{
 // Enter functions here
 }
```

instead of&#x20;

```csharp
/*MonoBehavior is not used in Terra Studio but instead used only in Unity*/
public class MyFirstScript : MonoBehaviour
{
 // Enter functions here
 }

```

###

### `Start()`

This function gets called at the start of the game object's lifecycle and can be used to perform actions at the start of a game

```csharp
private void Start()
    {
      // Enter code to dictate what happens at the start of the game
       
    }
```

### `Update()`

This runs on every frame and can be used to dynamically update interactions

```csharp
private void Update()
    {
       // Enter code to tell what should happen on each frame
    }
```



### `OnBroadcasted()`

This runs whenever a broadcasted signal is listened to by the object

```csharp
// There is an object in the scene that generates the custom broadcast  "signal" is 
public override void OnBroadcasted(string x)
    {
    // The code below executes doSomething when it listens to the broadcast x
        if(String.Equals(x,"signal")){
        doSomething();
        }
        
    }
```



## Adding Custom Variables to an Asset

Add custom local variables to an asset to use them in your scripts. To add a variable,

1. Select the asset to add the script
2. Go to the Logic Tab on the left
3. Drag and drop the Studio Machine Behavior onto the asset.
4. Enable Advanced Mode. The Inspector Panel appears on the right.
5. Go to the Object Variables tab. There are four types of custom variables you can create:
   1. String
   2. Int
   3. Float
   4. GameObject
6. Click on the + icon next to the variable you want to add. Each variable needs to have a name and a value.

## Accessing Variables in your script

Variables created in an asset can be referenced in all scripts that are added to that asset. Here is how you access the variables:&#x20;

First, declare new variables of the same type to access those created in the editor:

```csharp
private float myVariable1; // A float variable created to access the float variable created in the editor
```

You can access these variables inside any function:

```csharp
 private void Start()
    {
       myVariable1 = GetFloatVariable("a"); // Access the float variable 'a' created in the editor
       // Add code here
    }
```

You can do this for all variable types: &#x20;

```csharp
public class MyFirstScript : StudioBehaviour
{
 
 //Declare new variables to acceess the variables you have created
   private float myVariable1; // To access the float variable
   private string myVariable2; // To access the String Variable
   private int myVariable3; // To access the int variable
   private GameObject myVariable4; // To access the game object variable
    
    private void Start()
    {
       myVariable1 = GetFloatVariable("a"); // Access the float variable 'a' created in the editor
       myVariable2 = GetStringVariable("b"); // Access the string variable 'b'  
       myVariable3 = GetIntVariable("c"); // Access the integer variable 'c'
       myVariable4 = GetGameObjectVariable("d"); // Access the game object variable 'd'
       // Add code here 
    }

    private void Update()
    {
       // Add code here
    }

    public override void OnBroadcasted(string x)
    {
      // Add code here         
    }
}
```



## Generating a Custom Broadcast

You can create your own custom broadcast inside any function

```csharp


public class MyFirstScript : StudioBehaviour
{
    private void Start()
    {
         Broadcast("signal"); // Generates the broadcast "signal"       
    }

    private void Update()
    {
       // Add code
    }

    public override void OnBroadcasted(string x)
    {
       // Add code        
    }
}
```



## Accessing Behavior Templates

Terra has a list of logic templates which you can use readily. However, you can also modify these templates through T# wrappers for each template. To do so:&#x20;

First, access all the wrappers of a specific behavior template by declaring a variable like this:

```csharp
CollectableTemplate collect = (GetTemplate(typeof(CollectableTemplate) as CollectableTemplate);
//the variable 'collect' can now be used to access all the properties of the collect behavior
```

Now use this variable to change all the properties of that behavior:

```csharp
CollectableTemplate collect = (GetTemplate(typeof(CollectableTemplate) as CollectableTemplate);
collect.Score = 10; // Score is a property which can now be modified 
```

A list of T# wrappers that help you access the  variables for each template can be found in [T# Logic Template Wrappers](t-logic-template-wrappers.md).

# Configuring Game Logic

To make our game interactive, we introduce game logic, which brings the game to life and changes a simple, static game into an engaging world that reacts to what the player does.

There are three ways to add game logic in Terra Studio&#x20;

1. [Writing your own code in T-Sharp](configuring-game-logic.md#writing-your-own-code-in-t)
2. [Using Logic Templates](configuring-game-logic.md#using-logic-templates)
3. [Hybrid Approach - Logic Templates + Coding](configuring-game-logic.md#hybrid-approach-templates--coding)

## Writing your own code in T\#

**Terra Creator Studio** enables experienced game developers to implement custom logic using a scripting language called **T# (T-Sharp)**. T# is very similar to Unity's C#, making it easy for Unity developers to learn. The links below provide detailed guidance on writing T-Sharp code:

[Basics of T-Sharp](../coding-using-t/t-basics.md)

[Differences between T# and C#](../coding-using-t/t-donts.md)&#x20;

## Using Logic Templates

To accelerate the time to create games, Terra Creator Studio also provides pre-built logic blocks or components, known as Templates. These Templates represent various logical operations, conditions, and actions, and can be easily selected from the Editor and dragged and dropped onto Assets.

### What is a Logic Template?

A "Logic Template" is always added to an Asset.  It contains pre-built instructions on how  the Player, Assets and Game Systems should behave.  Here are some important things to remember about templates

1. A Logic Template is always added to an Asset.
2. Execution of a Logic Template is always triggered by a Start Event
3. A Logic Template can affect not only the Asset to which it is attached, but also other Assets, Game Scene Objects and Game Systems&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Logic template should not be added directed to an animated object.
{% endhint %}

### Start Events for Logic Templates

Logic Templates in Terra Studio start executing any of the five events listed below occur:

<table><thead><tr><th width="215">Start Event Name</th><th>Logic Template is executed when</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Game Start</td><td>The game starts</td></tr><tr><td>Mouse Click</td><td>You click the mouse</td></tr><tr><td>Player Touch / Player Collide</td><td>The Player touches or collides with the Asset’s collider.</td></tr><tr><td>Other Object Touch</td><td>The other Asset's collider touches the collider of the asset to which the Logic Template is attached</td></tr><tr><td>Broadcast Listened</td><td>A specified game signal is generated in the game. <br><em>E.g - If the Start Event is set to Broadcast Listened - 'level_finish', the logic template will execute only when the game signal 'level_finish' is generated during the game.</em></td></tr></tbody></table>

### Effects of Logic Templates

A logic template when added to an Asset can be set up to not only affect that Asset, but also other Assets, the Player, the Game Scene or even Game Systems.&#x20;

The most common effects of logic templates are :&#x20;

* Change in Player or Asset properties&#x20;
* Change in Game Scene Environment
* Change in Game Systems&#x20;
* Change in an Asset's Orientation&#x20;
* Create or Eliminates existing Game Scene Objects.
* Generate a Custom Broadcast Signal
* Enable an SFX or Particle

The last two effects - generating a broadcast signal and enabling an SFX or VFX is present in every logic template&#x20;

The other effects can be configured in the Editable Properties of each logic template&#x20;

### How to add Logic Templates

To add a logic template to an asset and customise it, follow these steps:

1. Select the Asset in the scene editor or through the Layers Panel.
2. Click the Logic tab in the Quick Access Menu on the left
3. You'll see a Logic Selector with all the possible logic templates&#x20;
4. Choose the logic template you want and drag and drop into the Asset
5. The logic template has been added to the Asset.&#x20;
6. You can configure the logic template's properties by selecting the Advanced Mode toggle button and editing the various accessible fields.
7. Once you make changes, click the Save button in the main toolbar.&#x20;

### How to execute logic templates in parallel

You can execute multiple logic templates on the same Asset in parallel. Each logic template can function independently and gets triggered by its own Start Event. &#x20;

### How to sequentially execute logic templates

&#x20;You can execute logic templates sequentially one after the other by using the Custom Broadcast Start Event.&#x20;

The first logic template can generate a custom broadcast signal upon execution. This broadcast signal can then be the start event of the second logic template

### List of Available Logic Templates

Terra Studio has a wide selection of logic templates for you to choose from. A logic template can be added to any Asset and configured to elicit the interactivity you want in the game. The table below shows a list of logic template and a short description of what they do. A detailed description of each logic template is given in the respective logic template page.&#x20;

## Hybrid Approach - Templates + Coding

Logic Templates are useful for both beginners and experienced developers. For beginners,  they reduce the need for extensive coding knowledge. For senior developers, they eliminate the need to write code from scratch for simple game interactions and save time and effort.

The limitation of Logic Templates is the inflexibility in customizing interactions, as only exposed properties are editable from the editor. We address this by providing wrappers for Logic Templates, customizable via T-Sharp code. These wrappers expose all editable properties to the developer, allowing for more complex interactions than the editor interface permits.

You can read more about how to access the Logic Templates through T-Sharp code in the documentation for [Logic Template Wrappers](../coding-using-t/t-logic-template-wrappers.md).&#x20;


# Configuring the Player

At the heart of every Terra game is the "Player" block. This is the visual character that represents users in the game. Here are the different actions you can perform to configure your player in Terra Studio:&#x20;

## Finding and Selecting the Player

You can select the player by clicking on the player's avatar that is visible in the editor mode. If you are unable to find the player, you can follow these steps:&#x20;

* Click on "Layers" in the Quick Access Menu on the left&#x20;
* Locate and Click on "Player".&#x20;
* Press the F button&#x20;

You will notice that the Player has a default child element TopDownPlayer  which in turn has two more children - ModelRoot and CameraRoot

## Editing Player Characteristics through the Editor Interface

Once you find and select the player in the editor,  the Inspector Panel on the right displays a list of customisable Player Properties. A list of these customisation actions are given below:&#x20;

### Transforming Initial Player Configurations

To do this, you need to select the topmost parent  element in the Layers , named Player.&#x20;

You will notice that can do three basic transformations of the player's initial configuration- `Move` , `Rotate` and `Scale`. When an object is selected 3 handles will appear around it, each representing an axis along which you can manipulate the object. Alternatively, you can also manually change the values in the Inspector panel to get the exact initial configuration of the player you want.&#x20;

### Selecting a Gameplay Controller

Gameplay Controller in the context of mobile or tablet gaming is a system that interprets the player's input on the touchscreen into actions and movements within the game.&#x20;

To change the player controller,  you need to select the topmost parent element in the Layers , named Player.&#x20;

When you select Player, you will see a dropdown on the inspector panel named Controller which shows the TopDown controller by default.&#x20;

**The TopDownController** Offers a third-person perspective without panning, this controller enables movement in all directions, allowing players to navigate their character in a figure-eight pattern. This type of controller is designed to enhance spatial awareness and maneuvering within the game environment, providing a comprehensive view of the surrounding area to facilitate exploration and strategy.

There are also other controlles which are currently hidden.&#x20;

* **RunForwardControllerNonAuto:** This controller requires the player to actively engage with the game by touching the screen to move the character forward. The character stops as soon as the touch is removed. Lateral movements to the left or right are controlled by swiping in the respective direction. This mode does not allow for backward movement, focusing entirely on forward progression and sidestepping.
* **RunForwardControllerAuto:** Similar in concept to the RunForwardControllerNonAuto but with a continuous forward movement mechanic. The player's character automatically moves forward, eliminating the need to constantly touch the screen for movement. Swipes to the left or right enable gradual lateral movement, diverging from instantaneous lane switches to a more fluid transition. This ensures a gameplay experience that requires strategic planning for movement while on the go.

### Editing Player Motion Properties

You can alter how players move through the game space. To edit these properties, you need to select the TopDown Player element (child of the Player element). Once you select it, you can by tweak these properties:

* **Lock to Look Sideways**: Toggle button to lock or unlock sideways view.
* **Scale**: Adjust the player's size (1 = Default).
* **Gravity**: Numerical field to set gravity strength. Higher values make jumps shorter and falls faster, affecting game difficulty.
* **Jump Height**: Set the maximum height for a player's jump. This influences gameplay difficulty and accessibility.
* **Jump Lock**: Toggle to disable jumping via a controller. Useful for creating specific challenges or controlling movement in certain areas.
* **Max Speed**: Define the player's maximum achievable speed.

### Editing Player Animation

The Player's animation can be edited by selecting the `ModelRoot` element under the `TopDownPlayer` element in Layers. The following animations can be edited by choosing from a list of pre-existing animations:

* Idle&#x20;
* Forward Running
* Back Waling
* Walking Forward
* Walk to Right
* Walk Left
* On Jump Start
* While in Air
* On Jump End
* Bump from back
* Bump from front
* Bump from left
* Bump from right

### Editing Player Camera Controls&#x20;

Terra Studio allows creators to edit the following camera control parameters during game play and define how users experience their game visually. You can change this by  selecting the Camera`Root` element under the `TopDownPlayer` element in Layers.

* **Camera Arc X Rot**: A numerical field through which you can define the camera's tilt, allowing for vertical adjustments. Players can aim upwards or downwards, enhancing interactions with objects or enemies located above or below.
* **Spherical Camera Positioning**:
  * **Camera Arc X**: Manages the camera's horizontal positioning, facilitating left-right movements around a focal point.
  * **Camera Arc Y**: Governs the camera's vertical placement for up-down movements, enabling varied angles and perspectives on the game environment.
* **Field of View (FoV) / Size**: A numerical field through which you can specify the visible game world area. A narrow FoV brings the world closer, ideal for precision tasks like sniping, while a wide FoV expands the view for exploratory gameplay, although excessive width can lead to edge distortion.
* **Camera Distance**: A numerical field through which you can adjusting the camera's proximity to focus points or characters, influencing the player's depth perception and detail awareness. Closer settings heighten immersion, whereas greater distances offer expansive views of the surroundings.
* **Camera Type**: Terra Studio supports both **perspective** and **orthographic** cameras, with each type significantly affecting how players perceive and navigate the game world.




# Setting up Game Systems

Game System blocks are systems which affect the overall game and not just individual Assets. Unlike Assets , SFX, Behaviors and Particles which are clearly visible or perceivable, Game systems run in the background but significantly influence the entire gameplay experience. All Game Systems are accessible by clicking on the Essentials button in the Quick Access Menu. The Builder Panel then shows a list of all Game systems.&#x20;

Some game systems that are present in Terra Studio are listed below:&#x20;

## Game Timer

The timer is a critical system that manages the time-related aspects within the game - particular useful in games involving countdowns or time-limited challenges.&#x20;

### Adding a Game Timer

To add a game timer, follow these steps:&#x20;

* Select the joystick icon in the Main Tool bar&#x20;
* Click on Game Timer

You can now see the Game Timer's properties in the Inspector Panel on the right.&#x20;

### Configuring the Game Timer

You can configure the following properties of the game timer in the Inspector Panel:&#x20;

* **Duration Input:** Enter the time in seconds for how long the timer should run.
* **Timer Type Dropdown:** Choose between counting up towards a target time (Count Up) or counting down from a set time (Count Down)
* **Generate Game Signal on Completion:** Generate either a Game Win signal, a Game Lose signal or a Custom Broadcast Signal once the timer is complete.&#x20;
* **Generate Game Signal at a pre-set time:** You need to do the following :
  1. Choose the "Broadcast Type" under Advanced Options and select "At."
  2. To generate the Game Signal, please input the time in seconds. For example, input "35" for the signal to occur at the 35th second.
  3. Choose your broadcast signal: "Game Win," "Game Lose," or a Custom signal.
* **Generate Game Signal at a pre-set frequency:** You need to do the following :
  1. Choose the "Broadcast Type" under Advanced Options and select "Every."
  2. Enter the number of seconds for the repeat interval of the broadcast in the Value Field. For example, for a repeat every 5 seconds, enter 5
  3. Choose your broadcast signal: "Game Win," "Game Lose," or a Custom signal.
* **Show UI Toggle:** Choose to display the timer on-screen or keep it running silently in the background.

## Score

The Score system tracks how players perform in a game, showing their competition level and progress. Every game automatically includes a primary score group called the Main Score\_GameScore. This group becomes active when you use certain game behaviors to change scores.

### Behavior blocks that enable you to update scores

The value of scores in score groups can be altered only by using these these behaviors:

* **Collectable Behavior**: Changing score on picking up items.
* **Update Score Behavior**: To change the score.
* **Reset Score Behavior**: Resets the score to zero.
* **Carriable Behavior**: Using score as a currency for carrying a certain object
* **Deposit Behavior**: Using score to place items in a specified location.

### Creating New Score Groups

You can create extra score groups to track different achievements. For example, if your game includes two types of items to collect, you can set up a separate score group for each type for independent tracking.

### Updating Score Groups

Once you have added one of the five mentioned behaviors, you'll find a "Group" option in the editable properties of the behavior. Here, you can either select Main to update the "Main Score\_GameScore" or create a new custom score group by selecting Custom.

After this you must also decide how much to change the score when the event starts. You can pick any integer for the change.&#x20;

### Configuring Score Groups

You can further configure Score Groups by selecting Essentials from the Quick Access Menu and clicking on the relevant score group you want to customize. Here are the options available

* **ShowUI Toggle Button**: Shows the score on the game screen when this is turned on.
* **UI Prefab Dropdown**: This option lets you choose from a dropdown menu the UI templates where ShowUI will display the score. These templates are predetermined.
* **Persistent Toggle**: Allows you to keep the same score group total when moving from one level to the next. If not chosen, the score group starts over at zero with each new level.
* **Save Best Score Toggle**: When selected, this saves the player's highest score.
* **Show Best ScoreUI Toggle**: When you turn on the "Save Best Score" option, it displays your highest score on the game screen.
* **BestScore UI PreFab Dropdown**: This lets you choose the UI templates that should display the highest score in ShowUI.

## Health

The Health system is a background system that tracks the player health. There are only three behavior blocks that can affect player health - the Increase Player Health, the Decrease Player Health Block and the Reset Player Health Block. By default, the player health is set to a value of 100. When the player health becomes zero, the player is respawned to the last checkpoint in the game.&#x20;

### Configuring the Health System

To configure the Health System, click on Essentials in the Quick Access Menu and select PlayerHealth. You can then configure the following properties of the Health system:

* **Auto Heal Rate**: Turn on Auto Heal and choose how fast the Health should go up every second.
* **Generate a Signal when Player Health becomes zero**: You can create a signal for winning a game, losing a game, or a custom message.

### Game Progress

The Game Progress System tracks the player's advancement in the game according to predefined progress points. It provides players with a sense of achievement and progression as they play. Multiple progress points can be added through the inspector panel, allowing for greater customization and flexibility in the game's structure.

#### How to add game progress system?

1. From the main toolbar at the top of the editor screen, select "GameProgress" to add the game system to the Essentials tab.
2. In the builder menu on the left side of the screen, navigate to the "Essential" tab.
3. Find the "GameProgress" system in the builder panel.
4. Click on "GameProgress" to open the inspector panel.
5. In the inspector panel, you can customize the parameters according to your needs and preferences.

<table><thead><tr><th width="318">Parameters</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Progress start</td><td>This parameter helps you define the point the game progress will be tracked.<br>Game starts - At the start of the game<br>Broadcast Listened -Starts tracking the progress when it listens to a broadcast from another object </td></tr><tr><td>Progress points </td><td>List of diffrent milestones in the game</td></tr><tr><td>Persistent</td><td>Game progress came be made persistent by checking the checkbox </td></tr><tr><td>BroadCast at points </td><td>Broadcast can be trigger when player reaches a paticular milestone </td></tr><tr><td>BroadCast On Completion </td><td>Broadcast can be triggered when player reaches the fine milestone.</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Level Mapper

In game development, leveling up is a core feature that not only marks progression but also enriches the player's experience by offering tangible rewards and new challenges. The Level Mapper game system is designed for customizing the upgrade paths of objects within a game. This can include example use-cases like:

* **Weapon evolution**: Weapons can evolve or be upgraded as players collect certain materials or reach particular benchmarks&#x20;
* **Building upgrades**:  to unlock new features or improve their efficiency (upgrading a farm may increase food production rates or a barracks might allow for the training of more advanced units.)
* **Character Progression:** Accumulating enough XP results in the character gaining a level, which might increase the character's stats (like health, strength, agility) and unlock new abilities or skills.

By utilizing the Level Mapper, developers can set clear, trackable goals for players, encouraging engagement and offering rewarding gameplay experiences as they watch their in-game assets grow and evolve.\

# Configuring the Game Scene

Once you have the Player configured, you then proceed to set up your interactive world - game scene. There are four types of Game Scene blocks you need to set up to finish setting up your game scene:&#x20;

* **Assets:** 3D elements, items, and structures, that players can see and interact with in the game world.
* **SFX :** Auditory elements and sound effects
* **Particles:** Visual effects like smoke, fire, and magical effects, adding depth and realism to the game's visual presentation.
* **Environment:** This includes the broader setting or backdrop of the game scene, encompassing weather conditions, lighting, and landscape features, which sets the mood and context for the player's adventure.

Here is how you can set up each of the above blocks in your scene:

## Assets

### Viewing and Adding New Assets to the Scene

Terra Studio has a thousands of pre-made assets for creators to use directly in their game without having to bother about creating their assets. Here are the steps you need to follow:

* Click on "Asset" in the Quick Access Menu.&#x20;
* Select the "Library View" in the Asset Panel that shows up. You will be shown a library of all assets and their preview. You can search for your desired asset by&#x20;
  * Typing Keywords in the Asset Search Bar
  * Filtering Assets by theme or category tags
* Once you find your desired asset, drag and drop it into the game workspace.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
:dart:  Currently you cannot import your own assets in the game. However, in an upcoming release cycle, you'll be able to upload your assets directly into the Terra Studio environment, making it easier than ever to personalise your games and bring your unique visions to life.
{% endhint %}

### Editing Asset Properties

Once an Asset is added to the scene, you can click on it and view a list of its editable properties in the Inspector Panel. You can edit the following properties of the asset:&#x20;

#### Editing Asset Initial Configuration

You can adjust the initial position, initial rotation and initial scale of the Asset by changing the values manually in the inspector panel or by adjusting the Configuration Gizmo next to the Asset

#### Editing Asset Appearance

You can edit the asset's visual appearance by editing its material properties:&#x20;

* _Color:_ Pick from the color wheel or set RGB values
* _Emission Color_: Pick from the color wheel or set RGB values
* _Texture_: Select from a list of available textures
* _Metallic_: Specify a numerical value between 0 to 1
* _Smoothness:_ Specify a numerical value between 0 to 1
* _Shader_: Select from a list of available shaders
* _Tiling_: Specify the X and Y tiling

#### Specifying Asset Collider

A Collider defines the physical boundaries of an object for collision detection. Colliders help determine when one object makes contact with another within a virtual space.

For any object in Terra Studio, you select from one of four types of collider shapes from the Inspector Panel dropdown:

* **Capsule:** Wraps the object in a capsule shape. Touching anywhere on the capsule counts as touching the object.
* **Sphere:** Surrounds the object with a spherical barrier. Touching the sphere means you've touched the object.
* **Box:** Encases the object in a box shape. Any contact with the box is like touching the object itself.
* **Mesh:** Follows the exact shape of the object. You have to touch the actual surface of the object to register a touch.

<mark style="color:red;">In addition, there is also an IsTrigger Toggle.</mark>

### Adding Logic Templates to Assets

To add a [Logic Template](configuring-game-logic.md#using-logic-templates) to your asset, follow the instructions on the page below:[Adding Logic Templates to an Asset](configuring-game-logic.md#how-to-add-logic-templates)

# Building Blocks of a Terra Game

Any game in Terra consists of four basic blocks -  Player, Game Scene, Game Logic and Game System.&#x20;

## Player

At the core of any game in Terra lies the "Player" , which is the graphical avatar representing players in the game world. The Player is customisable through a collection of editable features called Player Properties

## Game Scene

Having a player isn't enough for a game. You need a scene where the player can explore and interact. Game Scene blocks let you build this world. Without them, the player would just have a big empty space. There are four main types of Game Scene blocks:

* The "Asset" block - Any 3D object that is part of the game's world.&#x20;
* The "SFX" block - Any sound effect  that is added to the game
* The "Particle" block - Any visual graphical effect simulating anything from fire to rain to enhance the visual appeal and realism of the game
* The "Environment" block**:** This refers to the global settings that affect the overall look of the game space. Includes lighting, camera perspectives, and global shaders that give the game its unique atmosphere.

Each of these blocks is customizable & configurable through an associated set of editable properties.&#x20;

Each game can have multiple scenes.&#x20;

## Game Logic

Simply having a Player block and a Game Scene Object block won't create an engaging game experience. Interactivity is key, and this is where Game Logic plays a pivotal role. They are the essence of gameplay, turning a static scene into an immersive, interactive world. Game Logic is always added to Asset Blocks. That way you can program Asset blocks to follow specific instructions, enabling interactivity in the game in precisely the ways you want.

Integrating Game Logic into your game transforms the game into dynamic, interactive elements. Without Game Logic, you're left with a mere navigation through static scenes. It's the Game Logic that turns these scenes into a captivating game.

## Game System

Creating an engaging game requires more than just setting up Game Logic for individual Asset blocks. It's essential to establish a broader framework that outlines the game's fundamental mechanics and rules. This is achieved through the Game Systems. Unlike Game Logic, which dictates how specific assets react, the Game System influences the entire game's operation.

Game Systems can be divided into two categories:

* **Primitive**: These are the basic systems that handle elementary functions such as timing (e.g., countdowns, time limits), scoring (e.g., points awarded for achievements). They are fundamental to almost all games and provide the necessary structure for more complex systems to build upon.
* **Advanced**: These involve more sophisticated mechanics that can include progression mechanics (e.g., levels, unlocking features) AI behavior and economy systems (e.g., currency, trade)

## Game Signals

Game Signals are a mechanism for different blocks to communicate. Common game signals are Game Win , Game Lose or Custom Broadcast&#x20;

### Game Win

It is the signal generated when the player meets the win condition for a game

### Game Lose

It is the signal generated when the player meets the lose condition for a game

### Custom Broadcast

In Terra Studio, the most crucial tool is a custom broadcast signal. This lets you send a unique alert whenever a specific game condition happens. You can name each custom signal differently.

#### Generating a Broadcast Signal

The Custom Broadcast can be generated by any Game Logic, any SFX, any Particle or any Game System. Each broadcast signal is identified by a unique name that you can give it.&#x20;

#### Listening to a Broadcast Signal

Creating a Custom Broadcast isn't enough on its own. It becomes valuable only when there are broadcast listeners set up to receive it. In Terra Studio, Game Logic, Sound SFX, Particles, and Game Systems can all "listen" for these broadcast signals.

Multiple listeners can all receive and act on the same broadcast signal at the same time.&#x20;

## Summary

Games are built using several types of blocks:

* **Player**: Represents the character avatar you control.
* **Game Scene**: Construct the environment of the game.
* **Game Logic**: Make elements interactive, allowing you to engage with the world.
* **Game Systems**: Define the rules and dynamics that keep the game enjoyable and challenging, such as scoring and difficulty progression.

# Essentials

Essentials in Terra Studio refer to the core system properties that are essential to the game's functionality and overall experience, but not tied to any specific object or player. These are the overarching settings that affect the game environment and how the player interacts with and progresses through the game.

Some of the Essentials available in Terra Studio are:

* **Global Render Setting**: Customise the visual style of your game's environment with properties like Skybox, Bloom, Vignette, and Fog to create the desired atmosphere.
* **Level Mapper**: Configure the progression system of your game by tracking and managing parameters that determine how players level up and advance.
* **Player Properties**: Access and edit physics-based attributes such as maximum speed, acceleration, and gravity to refine how the player controls feel in the game.
* **In-Game Timer**: Implement a countdown or count-up timer to add time-based challenges or events within your gam

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note**: GlobalRenderSetting and LevelMapper are available by Default. The other essentials need to be manually added depending on your use-case. You can get more details about by clicking on their respective page links

# Level Mapper

In game development, leveling up is a core feature that not only marks progression but also enriches the player's experience by offering tangible rewards and new challenges. The Level Mapper is a versatile tool designed for customizing the upgrade paths of objects within your game. This can include example use-cases like:

* **Weapon evolution**: Weapons can evolve or be upgraded as players collect certain materials or reach particular benchmarks&#x20;
* **Building upgrades**:  to unlock new features or improve their efficiency (upgrading a farm may increase food production rates or a barracks might allow for the training of more advanced units.)
* **Character Progression:** Accumulating enough XP results in the character gaining a level, which might increase the character's stats (like health, strength, agility) and unlock new abilities or skills.

By utilizing the Level Mapper, developers can set clear, trackable goals for players, encouraging engagement and offering rewarding gameplay experiences as they watch their in-game assets grow and evolve.

### Parameters

It tracks the following parameters that dictate the conditions under which an object can level up.

<table><thead><tr><th width="257">Parameter</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><mark style="color:blue;"><code>Group</code></mark></td><td>A custom name that allows the game to kee track of the character that helps level up the game</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:blue;"><code>Cost Type</code></mark></td><td>The parameter that helps achieve the next level </td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:blue;"><code>Resource Tag</code></mark></td><td>The parameter whose value will be affected once we achieve level up</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:blue;"><code>Value</code></mark></td><td>Update in the property of the group name after you achieve level upgrade</td></tr><tr><td><mark style="color:blue;"><code>Currency</code></mark></td><td>Cost of upgrading to a new level</td></tr></tbody></table>
